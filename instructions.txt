Asteroid2.py
An asteroid impact simulator written for SmashFest 2020
Requirements:
	Python3
	Numpy
	Pygame
	smallmap.png - a 768x768 image file of a map

Controls:
	spacebar = release next asteroid
	r = reset


There are at total of 5 asteroid impacts.

Instructions:
To run the asteroid simulator double click on "asteroid2.py"

Describe the set-up:
	we have three "listening stations" around deptford that are detecting sound waves from asteroid impacts.
	The ISS is tracking impacts - it is reporting the impact locations, our "listening stations" are detecting them.

Wait for the first impact (press spacebar) - watch the soundwaves and see the listening stations react.
	Find the site on the ground map - mark it with a pushpin.
	Check the calibration of the listening stations - measure the distance to the pin - this should match the distances calculated from the software
	
Repeat three more times:
	press spacebar
	mark-up the impact site
	there's no need to recheck calibration.
	introduce the other data - in particular the "time delta" and "distance delta" - we will need these in a second!
	
After the fourth impact we will lose our connection to the ISS.
	"ISS: uplink LOST" is displayed.

Press spacebar to trigger another asteroid
	We can't see it!
	We don't know
		the impact time
		the time delay before each station detected it
		the distance to each stations
	We do know
		the difference in detection times, so
		how much closer the impact is to each station.
		
We need to find the impact site!
	Using two tape measures, find all the points that are "x cm" closer to station 1 than station 2.
	(e.g. choose a distance of 1m, find the intersection of a circle of radius (100 + x)cm and a circle of radius 100cm)
	This should give a hyperbola
	Repeat for the other pair of stations.
	Find the interesection of these parabola.
	Job done!


To reset:
	Press "r"

To quit:
	Press "q"
